# Apple Push Notification service

**Developer Certificate** – An Apple-Signed Certificate, with a private key generated by Keychain Access, that is unique to an individual developer for signing applications in XCode. You can have one per member of an Apple Developer Account.

**Device UUID** – A universally unique identifier for an iOS Device that gets registered in an Apple Developer Account, for use with Ad-Hoc and In-Development applications.

**App ID** – The unique identifier of an Application in the Apple Developer Account. These correspond to a certain set of service entitlements such as Push Notifications, HomeKit, HealthKit, Passbook, etc. Unless otherwise required by a service entitlement, these can be applied with a wildcard – e.g., “com.appirio.mobile.*” which will apply to “com.appirio.mobile.app1” AND “com.appirio.mobile.app2” – or may be set explicitly – which will ONLY apply to “com.appirio.mobile.app1” if that is the corresponding ID.

**Provisioning Profile** – A document specifying what combination of certificates, identifiers, and entitlements are allowed by Apple to make it onto a device.
